# TickerTracker
tracks the highs and lows of stocks by their ticker symbols.
This application is being created as a proof of concept using MySQL and Python to create a UI used for entering simple data and then rendering a report from that data.  Because this is a simple first step it will be created with generic, scalable components with the intent that it can be used in parts or as a whole in the development of larger projects in the future.
